General grading breakdown
-------------------------
Course grades will be given using the standard six-level grading scale from 0 to 5.
Course grade for Automating GIS-processes will be based on 1) final broader programming assignment and
2) weekly laboratory exercises, 7 in total.

.. note:: Deadlines for exercises are firm and given in the course schedule.
          Generally, exercises are due at the start of class the week following their assignment.
          If you anticipate you will not be able to submit any of these items by the given deadline, you should let me know as early as possible and must let me know at least one day in advance.
          Late write-ups will be marked down 25% per day late, so please submit it on time.
